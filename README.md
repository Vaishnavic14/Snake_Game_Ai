# Goal Description
Build a classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will feature a responsive design, score tracking, and smooth controls. Snake is a classic, high-score arcade game where the player controls a growing line (the "snake") that moves across a grid. The goal is to eat pieces of food that appear randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it gets longer. The game ends if the snake runs into any of the surrounding walls or if it collides with its own body.

# Proposed Changes
# 1 Easy Controls: Simple directional inputs (up, down, left, right).

# 2 Increasing Difficulty: The longer your snake is, the faster it moves and the harder it is to control.

# 3 High-Score Tracking: Challenge yourself to beat your previous best score!

# Design
Main entry point for the game.
Contains the canvas element and UI for score.
Styling for the game board, snake, food, and UI.
Modern, dark-themed aesthetic.
Game logic: movement, collision detection, score keeping, game loop.

# Verification Plan
Automated Tests:- 
None (Visual game).
Manual Verification
Open index.html in a browser.
Verify the snake moves with arrow keys.
Verify eating food increases score and snake length.
Verify collision with walls or self ends the game.
